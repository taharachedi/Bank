> **A simple yet powerful console-based system to manage client data including adding, deleting, and updating client information. 🛠️**  

---

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This **C++ project** simulates a **Client Management System** 🧑‍💼 that allows the user (an administrator) to manage client data, such as account numbers, names, phone numbers, PIN codes, and account balances. The system provides functionalities like adding, deleting, updating, and viewing client information. All client details are stored in a text file for persistence.

## ✨ Features  
- ➕ **Add New Clients**: Add a new client with details such as account number, name, phone number, PIN, and balance.  
- 📝 **Update Client Information**: Edit existing client details such as name, phone number, and balance.  
- ❌ **Delete Clients**: Remove a client from the system by specifying their account number.  
- 🔍 **View Client List**: View a list of all clients stored in the system.  
- 🗂️ **Find Specific Client**: Search for a client by account number and display their details.  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Client data is saved in a text file (`Client.txt`) ensuring the data persists across sessions.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### Core Components  
1. **Player Input**:  
   - The administrator can select options to add, update, delete, view, or search for clients.  
   - All client data is inputted through the console and stored in a text file.  

2. **Client Management**:  
   - **Add Client**: The system prompts for necessary information such as account number, name, phone, and balance.  
   - **Delete Client**: The administrator can search for clients by account number and choose to delete their records.  
   - **Update Client Info**: Modify client details like phone number, account balance, or name.  
   - **View Clients**: A list of all clients is displayed with their account number, name, and balance.  
   - **Find Client**: The program allows the administrator to search for a specific client by their account number.  

3. **File Handling**:  
   - All client information is written to and read from a file (`Client.txt`) to ensure persistence of data.  

4. **Menu System**:  
   - The program displays a simple menu to navigate between operations (Add, Update, Delete, View, Find).
